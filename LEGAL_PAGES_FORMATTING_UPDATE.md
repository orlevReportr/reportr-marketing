# Legal Pages Formatting Update

## Problem Fixed

The Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages were showing **raw HTML tags** (like `<br>`) instead of rendering them properly. The markdown tables were also not displaying correctly.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Required Packages
```bash
npm install remark-gfm rehype-raw
```

- **remark-gfm**: GitHub Flavored Markdown support (enables proper table rendering)
- **rehype-raw**: Allows HTML tags to be parsed and rendered in markdown

### 2. Updated Both Page Components

**Files Modified:**
- `/app/privacy-policy/page.tsx`
- `/app/terms/page.tsx`

**Added Plugins:**
```typescript
import remarkGfm from "remark-gfm"
import rehypeRaw from "rehype-raw"

<ReactMarkdown
  remarkPlugins={[remarkGfm]}
  rehypePlugins={[rehypeRaw]}
>
  {content}
</ReactMarkdown>
```

### 3. Enhanced Styling

**Improved Typography:**
- ✅ Larger max-width (5xl instead of 4xl) for better readability
- ✅ H1: 4xl with Playfair font, more margin
- ✅ H2: Border-bottom divider, more spacing (mt-12)
- ✅ H3: Proper hierarchy with spacing
- ✅ Paragraphs: Better line-height and spacing

**Table Styling:**
```
✅ Full-width tables with proper borders
✅ Header row with background color and bold text
✅ Cell padding (px-4 py-3)
✅ Border between rows
✅ Muted background on header row
✅ Clean, professional appearance
```

**List Styling:**
```
✅ Proper spacing between list items
✅ Consistent spacing around lists (my-4)
✅ Better visual hierarchy
```

**Other Enhancements:**
```
✅ Code blocks with background and padding
✅ Strong text properly highlighted
✅ Links with hover effects
✅ Consistent color scheme (foreground/muted-foreground)
```

```

✅ Tables displaying beautifully with borders and styling

## Table Rendering

The Privacy Policy includes a large data collection table. It now renders properly with:

| Feature | Styling |
|---------|---------|
| Header Row | Bold text, muted background, thick border |
| Data Cells | Proper padding, borders between rows |
| Column Width | Auto-adjusts based on content |
| Alignment | Left-aligned for readability |
| Spacing | Generous padding for easy scanning |

---

## HTML Support

HTML tags in markdown now render properly:
- `<br>` → Line breaks
- `<strong>` → Bold text
- `<em>` → Italic text
- Any other HTML → Properly parsed and displayed

This was critical for the Privacy Policy tables which use `<br>` tags for multi-line cell content.
