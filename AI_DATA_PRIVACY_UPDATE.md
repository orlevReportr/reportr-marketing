# AI Data Privacy Update - Summary

## Overview

Updated both the Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to **clearly emphasize** that data processed by AI partners (OpenAI) is used **only to provide service functionality** and is **not stored** by our AI partners thereafter.

This is a critical privacy feature for financial advisors who handle sensitive client information.

## Changes Made

### 1. Privacy Policy - New Section 1.4: "Our Commitment to AI Data Privacy"

**Added prominently at the beginning** of the Privacy Policy (right after Introduction):

```markdown
**1.4 Our Commitment to AI Data Privacy:** We understand the sensitivity of client
information processed through our AI-powered features. To protect your privacy:

- **Your data is processed by our AI partners (OpenAI) solely to provide service
  functionality** — transcription and report generation for your specific requests

- **Your data is NOT stored by our AI partners** after processing is complete

- **Your data is NOT used to train or improve AI models** — we have configured our
  enterprise API integration to enforce zero data retention

- **All AI processing is transient** — your meeting transcripts, client information,
  and reports are processed in real-time and immediately discarded by our AI partners

This means your sensitive client data remains under your control and is only
temporarily processed to deliver the service you request.
```

**Why this is important:**
- ✓ Front-loaded commitment visible to all users
- ✓ Addresses primary concern of financial advisors
- ✓ Clear, bold statements about data not being stored
- ✓ Emphasizes "transient" processing

### 2. Privacy Policy - Enhanced Section 7.5: "AI Partner Data Retention"

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
**7.5** Data processed by our AI partners (OpenAI) is subject to their data
retention policies (typically 30 days for API usage). We have configured our
integration to request zero data retention where available for enterprise API usage.
```

**AFTER:**
```markdown
**7.5** **AI Partner Data Retention:** Data sent to our AI partners (OpenAI) for
processing is **not stored** after processing is complete. We have configured our
enterprise API integration with OpenAI to ensure:

- **Zero data retention:** Your data is processed only to generate the requested
  output and is not retained in OpenAI's systems

- **No model training:** Your data is not used to train or improve OpenAI's models

- **Transient processing only:** Data is processed in real-time to provide
  transcription and report generation, then immediately discarded

This means your meeting transcripts, client information, and report content are
only temporarily processed to provide the service functionality and are not stored
by our AI partners thereafter.
```

**Key improvements:**
- ✗ Removed confusing "30 days" reference
- ✓ Clear bold statement: "not stored"
- ✓ Bullet points for easy scanning
- ✓ Explicit "immediately discarded" language
- ✓ Final sentence reinforces the message

### 3. Privacy Policy - Enhanced Section 9: "AI Provider Table Entry"

**BEFORE:**
```markdown
| **AI / Large Language Model Providers**

We partner with OpenAI as our primary large language model (LLM) provider to
enable AI features within the Reportr Service. Data processed by OpenAI for
generating outputs is subject to their API data retention policies (typically
30 days). We have configured our integration to request zero data retention
where available for enterprise customers. |
```

**AFTER:**
```markdown
| **AI / Large Language Model Providers**

We partner with OpenAI as our primary large language model (LLM) provider to
enable AI features within the Reportr Service.

**Data Processing Only:** Your data is processed by OpenAI solely to provide
service functionality (transcription, report generation). We have configured
our integration to ensure that:

• Data is processed only to generate outputs for your specific requests
• Data is **not stored** by OpenAI after processing is complete
• Data is **not used** to train or improve OpenAI's models
• Zero data retention is enforced through our enterprise API configuration

This means your meeting transcripts, client information, and generated reports
are processed transiently and are not retained in OpenAI's systems. |
```

**Key improvements:**
- ✓ Bold header "Data Processing Only"
- ✓ Bullet points for clarity
- ✓ Bold emphasis on "not stored" and "not used"
- ✓ Clear "transiently" language
- ✓ Final reinforcement sentence

## Key Messaging Throughout

### Consistent Language Used:

1. **"Not stored"** - Clear, unambiguous statement
2. **"Not used to train models"** - Addresses common AI concern
3. **"Transient processing"** - Technical but understandable
4. **"Immediately discarded"** - Strong, clear action
5. **"Only temporarily processed"** - Reinforces transient nature
6. **"Solely to provide service functionality"** - Limits purpose
7. **"Zero data retention"** - Absolute commitment
8. **"Enterprise API configuration"** - Shows technical implementation

## Why These Changes Matter

## Important Note

**Accuracy Requirement:**
These statements assume you have actually configured your OpenAI enterprise API integration for zero data retention. You should:

1. ✓ Verify with OpenAI that your account has zero retention enabled
2. ✓ Ensure your API calls include the appropriate parameters
3. ✓ Document your configuration for compliance purposes
4. ✓ Keep records of OpenAI's confirmation of zero retention

If you have **not** yet configured zero retention, you should either:
- Configure it immediately, OR
- Soften the language until configuration is complete
