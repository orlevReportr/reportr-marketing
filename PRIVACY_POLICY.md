## 1. Introduction and Scope

**1.1** We are Reportr, located in Sydney, NSW, Australia ("we", "us", and "our").

**1.2** Reportr is an AI‑powered platform for financial advisors that processes meeting recordings, transcripts, and uploaded documents to automate documentation tasks, create unified client records, and generate compliant financial advisory reports (the **"Reportr Service"**). The term "Reportr Service" in this Privacy Policy includes any associated products or services that we may offer from time to time. Reportr maintains a website at **reportr.ai** (the **"Site"**) which includes information about Reportr and the Reportr Service.

**1.3** For those who purchase or otherwise interact with us or the Reportr Service, all visitors to the Site, and all other individuals with whom we communicate in the course of running our business (each referred to as **"you"** and **"your"**), we are the controller of your Personal Information. This means that we decide which information and Personal Information we collect, and how to use it. The measures and rights set out in this Privacy Policy apply only where we are the controller of your Personal Information. Where we process Personal Information on behalf of third parties, we have Data Processing Agreements in place to cover our handling of that data (where legally required).

**1.4 Our commitment to AI data privacy**

* **Your data is processed by our AI partners (OpenAI) solely to provide service functionality** — transcription and report generation for your specific requests.
* **Your data is not stored by our AI partners** after processing is complete.
* **Your data is not used to train or improve AI models** — we have configured our enterprise API integration to enforce zero data retention.
* **All AI processing is transient** — your meeting transcripts, client information, and reports are processed in real‑time and immediately discarded by our AI partners.

This means your sensitive client data remains under your control and is only temporarily processed to deliver the service you request.

> **Changes to this policy**
>
> We may update this Privacy Policy periodically to reflect changes in our practices, legal requirements, or other factors. We will post the updated policy on our Site and encourage you to review it periodically.

## 2. Meaning of Personal Information

**2.1** Under the **Australian Privacy Act 1988 (Cth)** ("**APA**"), **"Personal Information"** means *information or an opinion about an identified individual, or an individual who is reasonably identifiable: (a) whether the information or opinion is true or not; and (b) whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not*.

**2.2** Under the **General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679** ("**GDPR**"), and the retained version of the same regulation in the UK ("**UK GDPR**"), **"Personal Data"** means any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person ("**Data Subject**"). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural or social identity of that natural person.

**2.3** For the purposes of this Privacy Policy, we use the term **"Personal Information"** to refer to:

**2.3.1** Personal Information as defined in the APA; and

**2.3.2** Personal Data as defined in the GDPR and the UK GDPR.

**2.4** If you are a resident of the UK or the EEA, your rights will be applicable only in respect of Personal Data, as defined above (even though, as explained above, we will use the term "Personal Information" to refer to this). If you are resident of Australia, your rights will be applicable only in respect of Personal Information, as defined in the applicable legislation above.

## 3. What We Collect, How We Collect It, and What We Do With It

**3.1** The Personal Information we collect from you, and how we collect it, will depend on the service you are purchasing and the way you interact with us.

**3.2** The table below sets out what we collect, how we collect it and what we do with it. We may state a more specific additional purpose when we collect your Personal Information.

**3.3** In some jurisdictions (in particular the UK and EEA), we are required to identify a legal justification (also known as a **"Lawful Basis"**) for collecting and using your Personal Information, in addition to describing the purpose. There are six Lawful Bases that organisations can rely on. The most relevant of these to us are where we use your Personal Information to:

**3.3.1** Fulfil a contract that we have with you as an individual ("**Contract**");

**3.3.2** Comply with our legal obligations ("**Legal Obligation**");

**3.3.3** Pursue our legitimate interests (our justifiable business aims) but only if those interests are not outweighed by your other rights and freedoms ("**Legitimate Interests**"); or

**3.3.4** Do something for which you have given your consent ("**Consent**").

Where we use your information for our legitimate interests, we have assessed whether such use is necessary and that such use will not infringe on your other rights and freedoms.

Below includes the Lawful Basis we rely on when we process your Personal Information, which will be applicable only to UK and EEA Data Subjects.

**3.4** In addition to the Lawful Bases set out in the table above, we may use your Personal Information (however collected) to fulfil a Legal Obligation if processing is necessary:

**3.4.1** to record your preferences (e.g. marketing) to ensure that we comply with applicable data protection laws;

**3.4.2** where we are required to assist government and law enforcement agencies or regulators;

**3.4.3** where we retain information to enable us to bring or defend legal claims; and/or

**3.4.4** where we are required to assist government and law enforcement agencies or regulators, including in relation to any eligible data breach declarations by any of them.

---

## 4. Anonymised and Aggregated Data

We may anonymise the Personal Information we collect (so it can no longer identify you) and then combine it with other anonymous information so it becomes aggregated data. Aggregated data helps us identify trends (e.g. what percentage of users use specific features or templates). Data protection laws do not govern the use of aggregated data and the various rights described below do not apply to it.

---

## 5. Use of Cookies and Similar Tracking Technologies

**5.1** Cookies are small text files that we store on your browser, or the hard drive of your computer, if you agree. Cookies collect data which includes Personal Information.

**5.2** We use our own cookies, and similar tracking technologies, to enhance user experience, provide security, and improve our services. We also use third party cookies. The following cookies (or similar technologies) are used on our Site:

**5.2.1 Essential cookies.** Required for the core functionality of the Site (e.g. authentication and security functions). These are always enabled.

**5.2.2 Preference cookies.** Recognise you when you return to the Site, personalise content, and remember your preferences.

**5.2.3 Performance cookies.** Help us understand how visitors interact with the Site (e.g. time on site; repeat visits) to improve service functionality.

---

## 6. Security Measures

**6.1** We take the security of your Personal Information seriously. We implement technical and organisational measures to protect against unauthorised access, disclosure, and loss of data, including:

**6.1.1 Encryption:** all data at rest is encrypted using AES‑256. Data in transit is protected by TLS 1.2/1.3.

**6.1.2 Access controls:** role‑based access control for internal systems, regular access audits and reviews, and principle of least privilege for employee access.

**6.1.3 Cloud security:** secure cloud infrastructure hosted on Microsoft Azure in Australia with network isolation and firewall protection.

**6.1.4 Monitoring:** audit trails retained for a minimum of one year and regularly reviewed for compliance and security monitoring.

**6.2** If there is an incident that has affected your Personal Information, we will investigate it, take steps to contain it, notify the appropriate regulator and keep you informed (where required under applicable data protection law).

---

## 7. How Long We Keep Your Personal Information

**7.1** We will only retain your Personal Information for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes we collected it for.

**7.2** To decide how long to keep Personal Information (also known as its retention period), we consider the volume, nature, and sensitivity of the Personal Information, the potential risk of harm to you if an incident were to happen, whether we require the Personal Information to achieve the purposes we have identified or whether we can achieve those purposes through other means (e.g. by using aggregated data instead), and any applicable legal requirements (e.g. minimum accounting records for tax authorities).

**7.3** If you have asked for information from us or you have subscribed to our mailing list, we keep your details until you ask us to stop contacting you.

**7.4** Upon account deletion, we retain your data for **90 days** for retrieval purposes, after which it is permanently deleted. Backup copies are deleted within **180 days**. Billing records are retained for **7 years** as required by law.

**7.5 AI Partner Data Retention.** Data sent to our AI partners (OpenAI) for processing is **not stored** after processing is complete. We have configured our enterprise API integration with OpenAI to ensure:

* **Zero data retention:** Your data is processed only to generate the requested output and is not retained in OpenAI's systems.
* **No model training:** Your data is not used to train or improve OpenAI's models.
* **Transient processing only:** Data is processed in real‑time to provide transcription and report generation, then immediately discarded.

This means your meeting transcripts, client information, and report content are only temporarily processed to provide the service functionality and are not stored by our AI partners thereafter.

---

## 8. Where Your Personal Information is Stored

**8.1** Your personal information is primarily stored in Australia using Microsoft Azure Australia regions (Australia East and Australia Southeast).

**8.2** However, like most organisations, we use various services and tools and we collaborate with our affiliates and business partners in countries different to your country of residence, including Australia, the US, UK and EU, and we may transfer your personal information as a result. Each recipient is subject to appropriate safeguards such as due diligence and standard contractual clauses or similar contractual provisions for international transfers of personal information.

---

## 9. Who We Share Your Personal Information With

**9.1** We may share your Personal Information with the organisations listed below, for the specified reasons.

**9.2** As outlined in the region specific sections below, this may involve transfers overseas.

**9.3** When we share your Personal Information with third parties to process your Personal Information on our behalf, we ensure that an appropriate Data Processing Agreement is in place, where required under applicable data protection laws.

**9.4** We can provide more detailed information about our specific service providers, their data processing locations, and retention periods upon request. Please contact us at **[info@reportr.ai](mailto:info@reportr.ai)** for such information.

## ADDITIONAL CLAUSES APPLICABLE TO RESIDENTS OF AUSTRALIA

> The following applies if you are located in Australia. If there is any inconsistency between this section and the rest of the Privacy Policy, this section will prevail.

### 13. Scope

**13.1** As mentioned in paragraph 2.4 above, if you are a resident of Australia, your rights in this Privacy Policy are only applicable only in respect of Personal Information, as defined in the APA.

**13.2** If there is any inconsistency between this "Additional Clauses Applicable to Residents of Australia" section and the rest of the Privacy Policy, this section will prevail.

### 14. Transfers of Personal Information Out of Australia

**14.1** Your Personal Information may be transferred overseas or stored overseas for a variety of reasons (including processing by OpenAI in the United States). If we transfer your Personal Information to a recipient in a country with data protection laws which are at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles ("APP"), and where there are mechanisms available to you to enforce protection of your Personal Information under that overseas law, we will not be liable for a breach of the APP if your Personal Information is mishandled in that jurisdiction.

### 15. Notifiable Data Breach Scheme ("NDBS") Pursuant to the APA

**15.1** If there is a data breach and we are required to comply with the NDBS, we will take all reasonable steps to contain the suspected or known breach where possible and follow the process set out in this clause.

**15.2** If we have reasonable grounds to suspect that the data breach is likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved, then we will take all reasonable steps to ensure an assessment is completed within 30 days of the breach, or sooner, if possible. We will follow all guidance published by the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner ("OAIC") in making this assessment. If we reasonably determine that the data breach is not likely to result in serious harm to any individuals involved, or that any remedial action we take is effective in preventing serious harm from becoming likely, then we will not notify the affected individuals or the OAIC.

### 16. Your Rights Under the APP and the APA

**16.1** If you are a resident of Australia, your data protection rights are as follows:

**16.1.1** You can request access to your Personal Information, subject to certain exceptions. For example we may, in accordance with the APP, refuse to provide you with access if, for instance, granting you access would have a negative impact on the privacy of another person.

**16.1.2** You can request corrections to any inaccurate, outdated, incomplete or misleading information regarding your Personal Information. If you request correction, we will address it within a reasonable timeframe and notify you of the outcome.

**16.1.3** We have an independent obligation to take reasonable steps to correct information that is inaccurate, out‑of‑date, incomplete, irrelevant or misleading.
