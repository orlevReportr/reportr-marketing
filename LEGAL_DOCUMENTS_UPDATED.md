# Legal Documents Updated - Summary

## What Was Done

I reviewed your FinPlan application code to understand what Reportr actually does, then completely rewrote your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service to be accurate, relevant, and based on Marloo's structure (since you're similar businesses).

---

## Key Changes Made

### 1. **Accurate Service Description**

**OLD (Generic/Inaccurate):**
- Vague references to "AI-powered meeting documentation"
- Mentioned irrelevant things like "health or medical information"
- No mention of specific technologies used

**NEW (Accurate & Specific):**
- **Clearly describes** Reportr as an AI platform for financial advisors
- **Specifies technologies**: OpenAI Whisper (transcription), OpenAI GPT (report generation), Recall.ai (meeting recording)
- **Lists actual features**:
  - Meeting recording via Recall.ai (Zoom/Teams integration)
  - AI transcription and report generation
  - Template system (basic & wizard templates)
  - Client record management
  - PDF/DOCX export
  - Email distribution
  - Calendar integration (Google/Microsoft)
  - SSO authentication

### 2. **Removed Irrelevant Content**

**Removed:**
- ❌ Health or medical information (not applicable)
- ❌ Government-issued IDs (not collected)
- ❌ Biometric data (not collected)
- ❌ Precise geolocation data (not collected)
- ❌ Children's information (not relevant)
- ❌ References to Anthropic/Claude AI (you use OpenAI)
- ❌ References to AWS/GCP (you use Azure)

### 3. **Added Accurate Third-Party Providers**

**Privacy Policy Now Correctly Lists:**
- ✓ **Microsoft Azure** (cloud hosting in Australia)
- ✓ **OpenAI** (Whisper for transcription, GPT for text generation)
- ✓ **Recall.ai** (automated meeting recording)
- ✓ **Google** (SSO, Calendar integration)
- ✓ **Microsoft** (SSO, 365 Calendar integration)
- ✓ **Stripe** (payment processing)

**Removed Incorrect Providers:**
- ❌ Anthropic (not used)
- ❌ AWS (not used)
- ❌ GCP (not used)
- ❌ Sendgrid/SES (not mentioned in your code)
- ❌ Cloudflare (not mentioned in your code)

### 4. **Accurate Data Collection Table**

The Privacy Policy now includes a detailed table showing:
- **What data is collected**: Meeting recordings, transcripts, calendar details, attendee info, client names/emails
- **How it's collected**: Via Recall.ai, Google/Microsoft APIs, user uploads
- **Why it's collected**: For transcription, AI report generation, unified client records
- **Legal basis**: Contract, Consent, Legitimate Interests

### 5. **Meeting Recording Consent Requirements**

**NEW - Important Legal Protection:**
Added clear clauses stating that **YOU (the user)** are responsible for:
- Obtaining consent before recording meetings
- Notifying participants that meetings are being recorded
- Complying with recording consent laws
- We are NOT responsible for your failure to obtain consent

This is critical for Australian financial advisors using meeting recording features.

### 6. **Professional Responsibility Disclaimers**

**Enhanced clauses** making clear:
- You retain full professional responsibility for all documents
- You must verify AI-generated content before using with clients
- We don't guarantee ASIC compliance (Australian financial regulator)
- You're responsible for regulatory compliance
- AI outputs may contain errors

### 7. **Data Retention Specifics**

**Clarified:**
- OpenAI retains data for 30 days (API policy)
- You've configured for zero retention where available for enterprise
- Account data deleted after 90 days post-termination
- Backups deleted within 180 days
- Billing records retained 7 years (legal requirement)

### 8. **Australian Focus**

**Strengthened:**
- Jurisdiction: New South Wales, Australia
- Hosting: Azure Australia regions
- ASIC references for financial advisor context
- Australian Privacy Principles (APP) compliance
- OAIC (Australian regulator) references

## Structure Based on Marloo

I used Marloo's privacy policy structure because you're very similar businesses:

**Similarities:**
1. ✓ AI-powered platform for financial advisors
2. ✓ Meeting recording and transcription
3. ✓ Calendar integration (Google/Microsoft)
4. ✓ Document generation
5. ✓ Client record management
6. ✓ Australian-based business
7. ✓ Target: financial services professionals

**Key Differences Reflected:**
- You use OpenAI (they use Anthropic + OpenAI)
- You use Azure Australia (they use AWS New Zealand)
- You use Recall.ai for recording (they have different approach)
- Your specific features (template wizard, PDF/DOCX export, email distribution)

## Important Notes

### 1. **Still Need to Add:**
- Your complete business address (currently just says "Sydney, NSW, Australia")
- Consider if you want to add a Data Protection Officer contact

### 2. **Before Going Live:**
- ✅ Have documents reviewed by Australian lawyer
- ✅ Confirm all AI provider data policies are current
- ✅ Ensure all third-party integrations listed are accurate
- ✅ Test that pages load at reportr.ai/privacy-policy and reportr.ai/terms
- ✅ Add URLs to Google OAuth consent screen

### 3. **Accuracy Confirmations:**
I based these documents on what I found in your FinPlan codebase:
- MongoDB database
- OpenAI Whisper + GPT
- Recall.ai for meeting recording
- Azure hosting
- Google/Microsoft SSO and Calendar
- Stripe billing
- Zoom/Teams integration via Recall.ai

If any of these are incorrect or you use additional services, let me know and I'll update the documents.

### 4. **What Makes These Better:**
1. **Honest and accurate** - reflects what your service actually does
2. **Comprehensive** - covers all actual data flows and processing
3. **Legally protective** - clear disclaimers about AI accuracy, meeting consent, professional responsibility
4. **Google compliant** - meets all SSO requirements
5. **User-friendly** - clear language, good structure
6. **Multi-jurisdiction** - covers Australia, UK, EEA properly
